# QRMeat Web Application Repository

This Repository was created to support the development of a Web Application in the subject of Web Applications lectured by professor Pedro Antunes in the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon. QRMeatâ€™s key feature is enabling users to quickly access  information about meat products via QR codes, including sustainability, processing details, nutritional value and user feedback. This repository contains architectural elements for both backend and frontend development as well as simple explanations and justifications for the decisions made. It also features an App Blueprint secction that connects both backend and frontend architectures in one easy to consult diagram for developers.
