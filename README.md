# QRMeat Web Application Repository

This repository supports the development of a web application for the Web Applications course taught by Professor Pedro Antunes at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon. QRMeatâ€™s primary feature is enabling users to quickly access information about meat products via QR codes. This includes details on sustainability, processing, nutritional value, and user feedback.
The repository contains architectural elements for both backend and frontend development, with clear explanations and justifications for the decisions made. Additionally, it features an App Blueprint section that connects the backend and frontend architectures in easy-to-consult diagrams for developers.
