# A Journey Through the Headlines (Check News Story)

## Motivation

The motivation behind this storytelling approach serves as an enhancer for user engagement and connection. Storytelling immerses users in a narrative that resonates with their emotions and experiences. By crafting a compelling story within the application, we aim to engage users on a personal level and provide app developers with a more identifiable and creative line of thought during development.

## Decision

Given the relatively simple nature of our application , opting for a 3-act structure provides a natural and easy to follow navigation experience. This approach allows us to focus our development on key narrative elements and essential user interactions. By eliminating the complexity of more traditional application development processes we can deliver a polished and functional application within a shorter timeframe.
