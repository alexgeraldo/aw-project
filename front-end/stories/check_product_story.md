# An Animal Tale (Check Product Story)

## Motivation

The motivation behind this storytelling approach serves as an enhancer for user engagement and connection. Storytelling immerses users in a narrative that resonates with their emotions and experiences. By crafting a compelling story within the application, we aim to engage users on a personal level and provide app developers with a more identifiable and creative line of thought during development.

## Decision

Given the relatively simple nature of our application , opting for a 3-act structure provides a natural and easy to follow navigation experience. This approach allows us to focus our development on key narrative elements and essential user interactions. By eliminating the complexity of more traditional application development processes we can deliver a polished and functional application within a shorter timeframe.

## Story Goal

The hero has in his possession a product that he wants to know more about.

## Story (3 Acts)

### Setup

The hero is in his everyday shopping when he finds a new and very interesting product that he does not know nothing about.

### Confrontation

The hero rapidly opens his QR Meat app and:

* Through QR code reader:
  1. Scans the QR code on the product

* Through searching:
  1. Selects the current supermarket
  2. Selects the type of product
  3. Finds the product he wants to know more about

### Resolution

Our hero is promptly redirected to the product page where he can assess everything known about that product, from nutritional data to the animal that generated that product and his history.
