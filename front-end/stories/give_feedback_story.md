# A Hero's Voice (Give Feedback Story)

## Motivation

The motivation behind this storytelling approach serves as an enhancer for user engagement and connection. Storytelling immerses users in a narrative that resonates with their emotions and experiences. By crafting a compelling story within the application, we aim to engage users on a personal level and provide app developers with a more identifiable and creative line of thought during development.

## Decision

Given the relatively simple nature of our application , opting for a 3-act structure provides a natural and easy to follow navigation experience. This approach allows us to focus our development on key narrative elements and essential user interactions. By eliminating the complexity of more traditional application development processes we can deliver a polished and functional application within a shorter timeframe.

## Story Goal

The hero wants to share is opinion on a given product.

## Story (3 Acts)

### Setup

Our hero tried recently a product that he liked very much and he really insist in sharing is opinion with other.
Our hero is on a dinner with friends and someone raises awareness about sustainability of the meat industry and its impacts.

### Confrontation

The hero rapidly opens his QR Meat app and:

1. Taps into the saved products page
2. Finds the product in his saved list and click it
3. Click on feedback button

### Resolution

Our hero is promptly sent to the reviews page where he can rate from 1 to 5 stars on how good he thinks the product really is. From there our hero can also check what other users think about that product.
