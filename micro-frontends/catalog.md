# Catalog Micro-Frontend

## Context
The catalog micro-frontend is responsible for numerous and various functionalities, all connected to the displaying of products 
and the respective supermarket selection.

## Decision

The decision to choose a catalog focused micro-frontend was business focused, but besides that it was intuitive since there are numerous 
views on the QR meat app related to the displaying and listing products (catalog functionality). Some other functionalities like listing marketplaces, displaying products nutritional value and leaving a review while not necessarily associated with cataloging, should on our view be developed on par with them as they are connected, so we can ensure seamless user experience on this micro-frontend. Promoting a scalable solution with the possibility of later added funtionality for different scenarios outside the QRMeat application.

## Consequences 
Developing a Catalog focused micro-frontend involves several benefits, but not without some drawbacks. (list drawbacks)
