# Authentication Micro-Frontend ADR

## Status

[Proposed]

## Context

Authentication Micro-Frontend is the set of the views and components enabling users to authenticate their accounts, alongside with account management and app preference capabilities.

## Decision

The decision to create this Micro-Frontend based on decomposition by "Business Capabilities" was driven by the potential to monetize authentication capabilities for third-party sales and facilitate reuse of views and components in future projects. Additionally, centralizing customer-related services offers the opportunity to establish a unified company client database, like what is done by major tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook.
